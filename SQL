Sales Performance Analysis: 
  Understanding which products are performing well and which are not. This could help in making decisions about product development, marketing, and inventory management.
Question:
  What are the top-selling products?

  SELECT TOP(10) P.ProductName, SUM(OD.Quantity) AS Top_Sales
  FROM Products AS P
  JOIN [Order Details] AS OD ON P.ProductID = OD.ProductID 
  GROUP By ProductName
  ORDER BY Top_Sales DESC

Supplier Evaluation: 
  Assessing the performance of suppliers in terms of delivery time, product quality, and cost. This could help in negotiating better terms with suppliers or deciding to switch to different ones.
Question:
  Which suppliers consistently meet their delivery times and which ones do not?

  SELECT S.CompanyName, SUM(CASE WHEN O.RequiredDate > O.ShippedDate THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS On_Time, COUNT(O.OrderID) AS Total_Orders
  FROM Orders AS O
  JOIN Shippers AS S ON O.ShipVia = S.ShipperID
  GROUP BY S.CompanyName
  ORDER BY On_Time DESC

Notes: I struggled to get the answer so I used the intetnet. My thought process before was to use the WHERE clause but the problem was going to be how to calculate the amount on the orders on time

Customer Behavior Analysis: 
  Understanding the purchasing behavior of customers. This could help in improving customer service and personalizing marketing efforts.
Question:
  What is the average order value and how does it vary across different customer segments or regions?

  SELECT O.ShipCountry, AVG(OD.UnitPrice * OD.Quantity) AS AVG_Orders
  FROM [Order Details] AS OD
  JOIN Orders AS O ON OD.OrderID = O.OrderID
  GROUP BY O.ShipCountry

Question:
  Can we identify customers who have stopped buying from us in the past year?

  SELECT C.CompanyName, YEAR(O.OrderDate) AS Date_Year 
  FROM Customers AS C
  JOIN Orders AS O  ON O.CustomerID = C.CustomerID
  WHERE YEAR(O.OrderDate) != 1998
Question:
  Which regions generate the most sales?

  SELECT O.ShipCountry, SUM(OD.UnitPrice * OD.Quantity) AS AVG_Orders
  FROM [Order Details] AS OD
  JOIN Orders AS O ON OD.OrderID = O.OrderID
  GROUP BY O.ShipCountry

Question:
  How does seasonality affect our sales and can we forecast future sales based on past trends?

  SELECT DATENAME(MONTH, DATEADD(MONTH, MONTH(O.OrderDate), '2020-12-01')) AS Months, SUM(OD.UnitPrice * OD.Quantity) AS Total_Orders
  FROM [Order Details] AS OD
  JOIN Orders AS O ON OD.OrderID = O.OrderID
  GROUP BY MONTH(O.OrderDate)

Notes: I looked up how to change the month numbers to month names to make it more readable

Inventory Management: 
  Keeping track of inventory levels to prevent stockouts or overstocking.
Question:
  Which products are frequently out of stock?

  SELECT ProductName
  FROM Products
  WHERE UnitsInStock = 0

Question:
  Which products are frequently overstocked?

  SELECT ProductName, SUM(UnitsInStock) AS Stock
  FROM Products
  GROUP BY ProductName
  ORDER BY Stock DESC
