The research uses data analysis tools to look for trends and discover patterns in the Northwind database. I tasked myself to use the Northwind dataset to uncover some products that perform better than others, receiving many orders and high revenues. The project will outline certain trends that will offer suggestions for improving product performance for the Northwind Traders company.

Potential business problems that could be addressed using this database:

1.Sales Performance Analysis:
  Understanding which products are performing well and which are not. This could help in making decisions about product development, marketing, and inventory management.
  
2.Supplier Evaluation: 
  Assessing the performance of suppliers in terms of delivery time, product quality, and cost. This could help in negotiating better terms with suppliers or deciding to switch to different ones.
  
3.Customer Behavior Analysis: 
  Understanding the purchasing behavior of customers. This could help in improving customer service and personalizing marketing efforts.
  
4.Inventory Management: 
  Keeping track of inventory levels to prevent stockouts or overstocking.
